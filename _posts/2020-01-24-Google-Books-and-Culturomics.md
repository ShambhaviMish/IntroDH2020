In this session, we discussed what services like Google books and BYU Corpa can offer to our understanding and knowledge of the world that science simply cannot. We talked about how this idea, or “culturomics”, or basically analyzing writing to find patterns that shed light on human behavior is a very powerful tool for our understanding of history, pop culture, and politics. To better understand this, we looked at ngram searches that could explain these areas, like “coffee” vs. “tea” to see how culture has shifted from events like the Boston Tea Party to the establishment of Starbucks. We also explored things beyond culture; we explored stereotypes like “smelly Indian” and could see which races (Native American versus Eastern Indians) they were most likely referring to in their work. We looked at an array of ngrams, and the rest of the significant ones are listed in leader notes of the schedule but another significant ngram we looked at was “woman‘s consent” and this had a really telling graph of how rape culture has changed over the years and that added to the discussion talking about the value of culturomics. 

Then we started talking about the limitations of Google books, specifically the sample size, OCR error, limitations after 2000s, and also problems in searching for what we want (human errors in analysis). This discussion led to thinking about how much we can base our conclusions on ngram culturomics in particular and which sources digital humanists might find to be more reliable.
