This course introduces students to core methods and readings in Digital Humanities. Students will read and engage with a wide array of sources, from foundational texts to fictional accounts to patents to legal briefings. In an effort to facilitate non-traditional collaborations, the course is open to (a.) humanities students curious about computational approaches to humanistic questions and (b.) students with technical, data-driven, or design backgrounds interested in contributing to humanistic knowledge. Please note: Freshmen are prohibited from registering for this course. Sophomores must obtain instructor permission.
