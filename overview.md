### Overview
This course introduces students to core methods and readings in Digital Humanities. Students will read and engage with a wide array of sources, from foundational texts to fictional accounts to patents to legal briefings. In an effort to facilitate non-traditional collaborations, the course is open to (a.) humanities students curious about computational approaches to humanistic questions and (b.) students with technical, data-driven, or design backgrounds interested in contributing to humanistic knowledge. Please note: Freshmen are prohibited from registering for this course. Sophomores must obtain instructor permission.

### What Students Can Expect From The Course
By the end of the course, students should be able to:
- Identify major currents of thought and scholarship in digital humanities.
- Assess digital humanities research projects. 
- Develop and complete research projects informed by readings and current methods in digital humanities.

### Course Procedures
- Although expectations are high for students in this course, the course goals are achievable with consistent focus and work.    
- Students must complete the assigned reading for each class period.
- Attendance is vitally important in a small seminar such as this.  More than 3 missed classes will negatively affect your participation grade.
- Lateness disrupts the entire class, especially in a small discussion course like ours. If you are more than 10 minutes late, it will be marked as half an absence.
- Your default participation grade is a C.  Only by participating actively in class and attending regularly (see above) will you be able to raise it.
- Laptops and tablets are permitted in class for class purposes only. Mobile phones are not permitted in class, unless explicitly permitted by the instructor.
- Readings distributed electronically must be printed out and brought to class in hard copy.
- You must receive prior permission in order to turn in a paper late.  
- Students who receive permission to turn in late papers will nevertheless not receive instructor comments.
- Failure to complete one of the graded assignments (blog post reports or final project) will result in an automatic F for the course.
