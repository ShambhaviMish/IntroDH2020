Reading lists will be culled by the instructor and the session's student leader down to a cap of about 120 pages of reading due for Wednesday sessions, and a cap of about 50 pages for Friday sessions. Course topics may change with a few week's notice, and the reading list will be finalized at least a week in advance.
